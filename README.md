# Snake
My Own Snake game with 2 player option, difficulty setting and Music!
    To run this .sln you will need to go into...

    StartScreen.cs Line:33:

    < Directory.SetCurrentDirectory(@"C:\Users\Marcus\Desktop\LaptopBackup\Progs C# + HTML - Copy\Snake2P"); >

    change this to the projects new directory.
    
    This is because i have not yet worked out the dynamic directory yet...
